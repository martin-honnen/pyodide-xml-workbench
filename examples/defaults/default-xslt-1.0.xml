                <ul>
                    <li>XSLT 1.0 (with <a href="#exslt-support">broad EXSLT support</a>) against XML input using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lxml/">lxml</a></li>
                    <li>XSD 1.1 or 1.0 validation of XML input using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/">xmlschema</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both XSLT transformation as well as XSD validation is happening in a web worker.</p>
                <p>With Chromium based browsers like Chrome or Edge you can now open a local file directory and select your main input and XSLT or XSD file and relative includes/imports to modules in the same directory or subdirectories should be resolved. </p>
